## Installation

You can download the Lodestone client from our [release page](www.example.com). We also have a [webapp](example.com) in early access. For any troubleshooting, see our [wiki](www.example.com).

## Safety & Security

Lodestone core is written entirely in safe Rust, and uses`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` . However we can't guarantee the safety of the crates and binaries we link to, as those may use unsafe rust.

Lodestone is created with security as a top priority. While most of the safety critical code such as login and permissions management have been tested thoroughly, **no formal security audit has been done for any part of Lodestone.**

We recommend you to always have safe mode on within Lodestone for the best security, read more about safe mode [here](example.com).


## Contributing

Lodestone is still new and we have **alot** of features planned for this year. Either way, we'd love to hear your feedback! If you have any suggestions, leave a GitHub issue or talk to us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/PkHXRQXkf6).
